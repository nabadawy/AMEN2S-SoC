# Energy Efficient Soc through acceleration for IoT applications
## Project Description:
In this project we are trying to design an SoC which can deploy a machine learning and do data encryption on the edge while meeting the constraints of the real time applications and without increasing the power usage.

### 1) Machine Learning Accelerator:
In this part .... More details could be found [here](https://github.com/nabadawy/Energy-Efficient-Soc-through-acceleration-for-IoT-applications/tree/main/ML%20Accelerator)
### 2) Data Encryption Accelerator
In this part .... More details could be found [here](https://github.com/nabadawy/Energy-Efficient-Soc-through-acceleration-for-IoT-applications/tree/main/sha3)
### 3) Accelerators integration with SoC
After finalizing the design of the accelerators, we integrated them with the Chameleon SoC (an open source ibex based SoC) to test the system effeciency. More details could be found [here](https://github.com/NouranAbdelaziz/ML_and_Sec_Accelerated_Chameleon_SoC)
